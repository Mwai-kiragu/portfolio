                        Programming has also been always an entreprenuer's very best friend.The reason behind it is just  imagine taking your business ideas

                                        A system architect doesn't  exist in a vacuum.It needs it's own database,firewall and many other components.And for that you require somebody who knows all about that

                                        An API is an Application Programming Interface Software and is a set of instructions, standards or requirements that enables a software app or app to employ features of another app
                                        for better services.An API is something that lets apps to communicate with each other.Customerslove you more if you give them a way to interact with yout software and their software.
